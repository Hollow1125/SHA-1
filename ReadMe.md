# SHA-1

This program uses several C++ libraries digestion functions to calculate hashes using SHA-1 algorithm and evaluate their performance level.
Libraries tested:
1. CryptoPP
2. Intel IPP
3. Standard Windows API

## Usage

To launch this programm head to ...\SHA1\x64\Debug or add it to your system variables (PATH). You will also need RAMMap to flush memory inbetween functions.
```
./SHA1.exe <\path\to\file>
```
